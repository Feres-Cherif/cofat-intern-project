## Internship Journal â€“ August 25, 2025

Today, I made significant progress in my internship, learning several key concepts and tools:

### Project Setup & Git
- Created a new repository and published it to my GitHub account
- Learned to use VS Code's built-in Git UI:
  - Using the Source Control panel to stage changes
  - Writing commit messages through the interface
  - Pushing changes directly from VS Code
  - Viewing file changes and diffs visually

### Angular Framework
- Initialized a new Angular project and learned about its core concepts:
  - Components as building blocks of the application
  - Component architecture (HTML templates, CSS styling, TypeScript logic)
  - How Angular's modular structure helps organize code
  - The importance of the component tree and parent-child relationships

### Component Development
- Built and styled two main components:
  1. Navbar Component:
     - Implemented responsive navigation
     - Added logo and navigation links
     - Styled with CSS flexbox for layout
  
  2. Hero Section Component:
     - Created an engaging layout with text and image
     - Implemented responsive design principles:
       - Flexbox for layout management
       - Media queries for mobile adaptation
       - Relative units for scalable design
       - Mobile-first approach to styling

### Web Development Skills
- Practiced responsive design techniques:
  - Using CSS media queries for different screen sizes
  - Implementing flexible layouts with flexbox
  - Managing images and content responsively
  - Testing across different viewport sizes

Overall, I am satisfied with my workflow and the structure of my project so far. The hands-on experience with Angular, Git, and responsive design has been very valuable. I am ready to continue with the next tasks in the plan tomorrow.
